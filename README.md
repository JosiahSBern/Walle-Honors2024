# Walle Game
Welcome to Walle, an engaging simulation game blending robotics, environmental awareness, and interactive gameplay. Inspired by the movie WALL-E, this project  allows user players to control a robot and is tasked with bring trash to they're apporiate bins disigushed by being either **Trash**, **Recyclying**, or **Paper**. This is done using Ros2 and a Turtlesim enviornement. 

## Overview
Walle-Honors2024 is a ROS2-based project implemented in C++ and centered on a robotic simulation inspired by environmental sustainability and robotics. The system includes:
  Teleop Turtle: A user-controlled robot that serves as the leader.
  Trash Turtle: Which represnts types of trash the "Wall-e" mus pick up and deliver to its bin
  Game Enviornment
  
## Game Objective
The player must guide Trash Turtles to their respective bins as quickly and efficiently as possible. Each Trash Turtle represents a different type of waste (trash, recycling, or paper) and must be deposited into the corresponding bin.
## Goals and Objectives
  An engaging platform to explore robotics
  An interactive, challenge-driven simulation to entertain and educate the imporance of recylcing
  A scalable project that can evolve into a real environemt
### Prerequisites
Ubtuntu Envrionemnt
ROS2 Jazyy or later.
turtlesim package installed:
  sudo apt install ros-jazzy-turtlesim

### Installation

## How to Play
Control the Teleop Turtle: Use your keyboard to move the Teleop Turtle around the environment.
Sort Trash Turtles: Navigate to the Trash Turtles and guide them to their respective bins (Trash, Recycling, or Paper)
